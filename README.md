- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @learnbro
- ðŸ‘€ I recently gratuated from mechanical engineering department.
- I realized that I want to go into the software development and I am trying to combine my career path with mechanical design and software development.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python,html,css,javascript and swift. I know that it will be a long journey but at least I am trying to improve myself.
